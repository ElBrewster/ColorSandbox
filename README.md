## **Overview**
This is a fun little project I did over my break to review React fundamentals. I gathered hex code color data and set it up in files for a front-end UI-intensive app experience. My goal was to get more comfortable handling state, local storage, conditional rendering, and to do a CSS review on responsive layouts. Since I made this app for myself for fun, I thought about how I might use it when designing other websites as a color picking aide for new palettes. The Sandbox container will be great for assessing color palettes with the Colorblindly Chrome add-on, and then with the Randomizer I can get ideas from a pre-set collection of 450 colors.
